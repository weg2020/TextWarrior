<h2><a id = "navigation">MOVING THE CURSOR</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	<p>Making text editing easier with a touch screen is always a priority of TextWarrior. 
	That's why there are five methods available for positioning the cursor,
	to suit your preferred style of working.</p>
	<p>These can be accessed from <em>Settings → Cursor navigation</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Basic</h3>
	<p>Tap anywhere on the text.</p>
	<p>You can also touch the cursor and drag it to the desired position. 
	This only works when <em>Settings → Drag select</em> is disabled.</p>
	<p>The basic method is always active, even if another navigation method is chosen.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Trackpad</h3>
	<p>Tap <span><img src="images/trackpad_open.png" alt="Minimize icon"><span>
	 at the bottom of the screen to display the trackpad.</p>
	<p>To move the cursor, move in the desired direction on the trackpad.</p>
	<p>Tap anywhere on the trackpad to hide it again.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Yo-yo</h3>
	<p>Grab the round handle dangling below the cursor and drag it in the desired direction.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Liquid</h3>
	<em>Available only on devices with accelerometers.</em>
	<p>Press and hold the fire button at the bottom of the screen to activate liquid mode.</p>
	<p>In liquid mode, the cursor can be moved by tilting the device in the desired direction.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Up: Screen faces the sky
	<li>Down: Screen is vertical and faces you. Bottom of the screen points towards the ground.
	<li>Left: Screen is tilted to the left
	<li>Right: Screen is tilted to the right
	<li>Rest (no movement): Screen faces you at a 45 degree angle with the ground
	</ul>
	<p>Release the fire button to freeze cursor movement and exit liquid mode.</p>
	<p>For best results, disable automatic switching of portrait and landscape modes 
	on your device. Also, avoid moving the cursor in 2 directions at the same time.</p>
	<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This mode is power-intensive. Watch those battery levels!</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Volume keys</h3>
	<p>Press the volume up/down key to move the cursor to the left/right.</p>
	<p>In this mode, the volume keys will no longer control the device volume. However, 
	the keys will work normally again when switching to another application.</p>
</div>


<h2><a id = "selection">TEXT SELECTION</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Making a selection</h3>
	<p>Double-tap anywhere on the text to enter selection mode.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, if <em>Settings → Drag select</em> is enabled, simply touch and drag the cursor.</p>
	<p>With a hardware keyboard, you can also hold shift and press any direction key.</p>
	<p>In selection mode, the cursor will change into a shorter rectangle.</p>
	<p><strong>Tip:</strong> After double-tapping, you can leave your finger on the screen and start changing the selection range immediately.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Changing the selection range</h3>
	<p>Drag either end of the selection to the desired position.</p>
	<p>The cursor navigation methods described above can also be used. Tap on the 
	beginning or end of the selection to move the cursor there, to make it the target 
	of the current navigation method.</p>
	<p>With a hardware keyboard, you can also hold shift and press a direction key.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Cancel a selection</h3>
	<p>To exit selection mode, tap any unselected area.</p>
	<p>You can also double-tap on the selected text.</p>
	<p>With a hardware keyboard, you can also press any direction key.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Selection properties</h3>
	<p>The <em>Properties</em> option available from the main menu shows statistics related to 
	the selection like word and character count. If there is no selection, statistics for the 
	entire file will be shown instead.</p>
</div>


<h2><a id = "clipboard">CLIPBOARD</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	<p>The arrow tab at the top right corner of the screen opens the clipboard.</p>
	<p>Tap or drag it down to display the clipboard.</p>
	<p>Tap the arrow again or drag it up to close the clipboard. 
	The clipboard can also be closed by flicking it upwards.</p>
</div>


<h2><a id = "find">FIND / REPLACE</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Display the find and replace bars</h3>
	<p>Toggle the display of the find bar by selecting "Find" on the menu.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, press the "Search" button on your device if it has one.</p>
	<p>The replace bar is normally hidden from view. 
	To display it, tap <span><img src="images/arrow_down.png" alt="Double arrows down"><span>
	at the left of the search text box. Tap it again to hide the replace bar.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Button guide</h3>
	<p><span><img src="images/find_forwards.png"><span> Search forwards</p>
	<p><span><img src="images/find_backwards.png"><span> Search backwards</p>
	<p><span><img src="images/replace.png"><span> Replace selected text</p>
	<p><span><img src="images/replace_all.png"><span> Replace all</p>
	<p><span><img src="images/settings.png"><span> Find options</p>
</div>


<h2><a id = "keyboard">HARDWARE KEYBOARD GUIDE</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	The following shortcuts apply to most hardware keyboards.
	<p>Shift + Enter: Switch between the find/replace bar and the main text area</p>
	<p>Shift + Space: Insert a tab</p>
	<p>Long-press of alphabetical key: Capitalizes the letter, if 
		<em>Settings → Long-press caps</em> is enabled</p>
</div>


<h2><a id = "settings">SETTINGS</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
<h3>Auto-backup</h3>
<p>If "Auto-backup" is enabled, a backup of unsaved edits will be made to the SD 
	card in the following scenarios:
	<ol>
	<li>Switching to another app
	<li>Entering the TextWarrior settings page
	<li>Entering the TextWarrior file browser to open/save a file
	<li>Force close by the system
	</ol>
	With large files, auto-backup might take a while and TextWarrior may 
	appear to be unresponsive in the above scenarios. Please be patient and 
	things would be back to normal once the backup is complete.
<p>If you want faster performance in the above scenarios, or if you routinely 
	work with large files, or want to conserve battery/SD card space, consider 
	turning auto-backup off. However, unsaved edits will be lost if the system 
	force closes TextWarrior to reclaim memory. This happens when there are too 
	may apps open and TextWarrior is not the app being used at the moment.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Auto-backup feature will only work if an SD card is
	available and has sufficient space to make a backup of the edited file.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
<h3>Encoding and line terminator style</h3>
<p>If you don't understand these settings, you don't need to -- leave them as "Auto".</p>
</div>


<h2><a id = "roadmap">WHAT'S NEW</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	<h3>v0.92</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Fixed bug: Software keyboard in numeric mode reverts to alphabetical mode
		unintentionally when a soft key is pressed
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>v0.91</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Auto-backup
	<li>Progress dialogs display the type of operation that is ongoing, 
		instead of a generic "Please wait" message
	<li>Feedback when replace operation is unsuccessful
	</ul>
</div>


<h2><a id = "issues">KNOWN ISSUES</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	<ul>
	<li>Word-wrap mode is not optimized. With very large files (32000+ lines or 
		>1MB), there may be a noticeable lag and progress bars may not be 
		reflective of true progress status. 
	    For better performance with huge files, consider working in non-word-wrap mode
	<li>In landscape mode, the virtual keyboard can obscure the cursor
	<li>In landscape mode, the text suggestions given by the virtual keyboard is not visible
	<li>Long-press behavior on certain Motorola hardware keyboards do not work
	<li>If there is not enough memory when editing text, TextWarrior will crash without saving
	<li>The cut/copy/paste buttons only apply to the main text, not the find and replace text boxes
	<li>C#: Verbatim strings are not supported
	<li>PHP: Only keywords in lowercase are recognised. Parameters passed by 
		reference are not colored. Heredoc and Nowdoc are not supported
	<li>Syntax highlighting takes a long time when the file is very large
	<li>Files containing a mix of line terminator styles may not open correctly
	</ul>
</div>
